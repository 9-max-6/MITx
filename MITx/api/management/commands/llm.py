                                to prepare and deliver an independent evaluation of the Human\r\nRights, \
                                    Inclusion and Empowerment (HRIE) Umbrella Trust Fund.  \
                                    The objectives for this independent\r\nevaluation include: \
                                        (a) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of \
                                            the\r\nfinancial and technical inputs provided by the HRIE in generating \
                                                results at HQ\r\nand country levels and how it can be strengthened in the future; \
                                                (b) assess the\r\nsustainability of the HRIE’s outcomes, and in particular \
                                                    institutional\r\nsustainability, and how it can be strengthened in the future; \
                                                    (c) identify\r\ninternal and external factors contributing to the ability of the HRIE to\r\nfulfill its mandate; and, (d) identify good practices \
                                                        and lessons learned and\r\nexplore options for a \
                                                            future trust fund phase. </p><p>The evaluation has a dual purpose of assessing results ex-post \
                                                            and\r\nproviding recommendations for continuation of the Umbrella.  The evaluation also seeks the evaluators to provide\r\nrecommendations \
                                                                for consideration and action by development partners and\r\ndecision-makers \
                                                                    and stakeholders in the World Bank, especially related \

The application of the criteria should be\r\nconsistent with the summative nature of the evaluation and the operational\r\nmodel of HRIE within the Bank’s Social Inclusion Global Practice. The\r\nevaluators are encouraged to further develop and refine the guiding questions\r\npresented below under each criterion and to include additional questions they\r\nmay deem important.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal">The\r\nevaluators should propose the appropriate methodology – reflecting both\r\nperformance and process evaluation, as well as recommendations for future\r\nimprovements. The evaluation should be conducted based on key evaluation\r\nquestions, which may include key informant interviews, desk review of core\r\nactivity documentation (proposal summary forms, project and program progress\r\nreports, program annual reports, Partnership Council (governing body) meeting\r\nminutes, program charter, secondary data sources, etc.).  </p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"> </p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aeftimiadis_worldbankgroup_org/Documents/LDriveWBG/1%20Social%20GLU/HRDTF/Evaluation/Advertisement%20text.docx#_ftnref1" rel="nofollow"><i><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"><b><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:107%">[1]</span></b></span></i></a><i><span \
