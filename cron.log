Achieving this depends on replacing fossil fuel use in the heating and transportation sectors with renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Georgia is net dependent on energy imports for transportation, heating, and electricity. Imported natural gas and oil accounted for 48% and 27% of the total energy supply in 2020. GHG emissions from fossil fuel use amounted to 9 Mt in 2020, with natural gas consumption accounting for 55% of total emissions. Meanwhile, residential heating accounted for 45% of emissions related to the use of natural gas.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6pt;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:12.05pt"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">In line with the NDC, the draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) prioritizes decarbonizing the economy, strengthening energy security, and increasing research, innovation, and competitiveness. The development of Georgia’s geothermal resources has been includedin the NDC given Georgia’s significant geothermal heat potential in at least 44 sites with a total estimated capacity of 250 million m<span style="font-size:12px;line-height:0;vertical-align:baseline">3</span>per year.

This review of the state and economic and financial viability of the use of geothermal heat intends to help revive the development of the sector. Many systems and wells have been destroyed or abandoned due to the impact of the 1992 conflict in Western Georgia, a lack of maintenance, and substandard operation (especially in Tbilisi), and a lack of financing and knowledge (especially in agriculture).</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif"></span></p><p style="color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 )"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">The World Bank invites consultants to present technical and financial proposals to conduct an <i>assessment of direct use of geothermal energy in Georgia</i>.</span></b></p><p style="color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 )"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">The objective of the assessment is to review<span style="letter-spacing:0.1pt"> the state of Georgia’s existing wells and the regulatory framework, and assess the potential and viability for direct use for space heating, agricultural greenhouses, and power production</span></span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif;letter-spacing:0.1pt">. </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif;letter-spacing:0.1pt">The assessment is expected to confirm the state and readiness of existing wells for utilization, and identify the technical and economic viability to expand the</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif"> use of geothermal for<span style="letter-spacing:0.1pt"> space heating, greenhouse expansion, and power generation in Georgia.</span></span></p><p style="color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 )"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.12px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif"><span style="letter-spacing:0.1pt">Please base your proposal on review and information provided in the 2001 Georgia Geothermal Reconnaissance Study available under the following link. </span></span><a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/fkitt_worldbank_org/ErHDsYo1LOlKqAip3xpO67YB8SvAtkWCmVYdFfNmmBosFA" rel="nofollow">Geothermal Reconnaissance Study Georgia</a>. </p><p style="color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 )"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:normal"><a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jhuenteler_worldbank_org/Documents/ECA/GA%20Power%20Sector%20Files%20&amp;amp;%20Data/WB%20Projects%20&amp;amp;%20Reports/P500633%20Geothermal%20ASA/2.%20Procurement/Georgia%20Geothermal%20Firm%20ToR.docx#_ftnref1" style="background-color:rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">[1]</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">The temperature of Georgia’s geothermal waters varies between 30-175 °C.</span><br /></p><p></p><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0C4440: ESMAP</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

Thisis compounded by a steady increase in the number of years lived with adisability due to mental disorders (per 100,000 people) in Senegal over thelast decade. Mental health in adulthood is an important determinant of adultproductivity and human capital development. A systematic review andmeta-analysis of available evidence estimates that mental health interventionsare associated with improvements in various labor related outcomes – abilityto work; time spent working; functioning at work; education level; and assets.Additionally, parental mental health influences parenting behavior/health;parenting choices; and parent-child interactions. Parenting, especially inearly childhood, has significant implications on child health; and cognitive,emotional, social, and behavioral development. </p><p style="text-align:justify">In order toaddress growing mental health concerns in Senegal, and the associated impact onboth productivity and human capital development, the World Bank will pilot andassess Self-Help Plus (SH&#43;) in four communes in Senegal. SH&#43; is a group-based mentalhealth intervention, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), which teachesparticipants stress management skills. This program will be piloted using thedelivery mechanisms of the Government of Senegal’s social protection program,which is supported by the World Bank. Specifically, cash transfers for thepoorest households and accompanying information-based activities to supportimprovements in human capital development and productive capacity. The SH&#43;pilot will target social protection beneficiaries in Parcelles Assainies,Cherif Lo, Sebikotane, and Thies Nord. SH&#43; sessions will be facilitated bysocial protection service providers – community workers.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The World Bank isseeking a firm to conduct the following activities: (1) qualitative work forthe transcultural translation and adaptation of psychological survey tools includedin the baseline and endline surveys; and (2) comprehensive baseline and endlinesurveys to assess our translation and adaptation of the SH&#43; program and material,for the Senegalese context.

financial and technical inputs provided by the HRIE in generating results at HQ
and country levels and how it can be strengthened in the future; (b) assess the
sustainability of the HRIE’s outcomes, and in particular institutional
sustainability, and how it can be strengthened in the future; (c) identify

Livelihoods like pastoralism and agropastoralism heavily rely on water access and suitable grazing areas. Freshwater resources also support fishing livelihoods, coastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, reefs), and disaster risk reduction efforts. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, thereby presenting challenges to the continuity of these traditional livelihoods and the resultant impacts on local economies. The adverse impacts of water-related stocks, such as droughts and floods, can trigger displacement and migration, pushing more people into poverty. Political instability and poor governance contribute to water resource degradation, gender inequality in access to water, and water-related conflicts, thereby exacerbating Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) situations that undermine community resilience and adaptability. Conversely, improved management of natural resources can have a rebounding effect considering the challenges faced by coastal communities.  </span><span style="font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify">The consultancy is

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam). Location selection focuses on middle-income countries, with insurancecompanies of sizeable portfolio exposure to large risks and from diverseregions to reach a comprehensive outlook.</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

Its primary objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive economicgrowth by supporting the development of a strong and resilient financialsector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makes financial investments to promotethe development of accessible and affordable insurance markets in emergingmarkets.The global insurance marketplace benefits from transfer ofpeak risks to efficient carriers, mainly the global reinsurers. In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

hereinafter) are the following: </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the practices of different categories of
merchants within different regions in including the rural versus urban split
for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Obtaining the most accurate sample frame (e.g., from
the agencies for statistics) ensuring the size and sector definitions above are
met. </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">2.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face
surveys, while enumerators should have at least 2 years of experience in
face-to-face surveys. The project manager should have at least 5 years of
experience in coordinating surveys. </p><h4>Piloting</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The implementing contractor must test the questionnaire with different
types of respondents (urban/rural, size of merchant, grocery, non-grocery,
etc.) with at least 30 merchants. The implementing contractor must send to the
World Bank Task Manager the data collected from the pilot exercise as well as a
report describing any problems encountered and the proposed solutions. The
report must include any issues that arise as a result of the piloting. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">All modifications to the questionnaire, instructions and sampling
structure that may be suggested from the piloting results must be approved by
the World Bank Task Manager before the survey is implemented. The full survey may
not be launched until the survey instrument is finalized and approved by the
World Bank Group Task Manager. Any changes to the format or ordering of the
questionnaire to facilitate implementation should be consulted with and
approved by the World Bank Task Manager.</p><h4>Data Quality</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The contractor should ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, via
established procedures to check the quality of the data periodically. The
contractor should submit these procedures as part of the proposal.</p><h4>Deliverables</h4><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is

<p><span style="text-align:justify">The Government of Jordan (GOJ) jointly with the World Bank has developed a program for Inclusive, Transparent and Climate Responsive Investments Program-for-Results (PforR). The Program aims to help Jordan improve accountability to foster climate responsive investments and growth.

It also supports the implementation of the Economic Modernization Vision 2033 and its sustainability pillar, which is expected to help promote creating a new phase of economic growth by fueling investments (both domestic and international) in greener projects(technologies, infrastructure, and products), sparking entrepreneurial and innovative solutions, enhancing the export competitiveness, and ultimately, creating high quality and sustainable jobs for the future.

It is also the second largest landowner, possessing large tracts of land along the railways and surrounding station areas. The Nairobi commuter rail system serves around 13,000 passengers per day on four lines totaling 155 kilometers. A large proportion of KRC-owned land is yet to be effectively utilized/developed to boost urban development and generate additional revenue which can support the commuter rail operation. Additionally, land abutting the extensive commuter railway line presents a diverse and largely untapped financing avenue towards unlocking the financing gap needed to boost commuter rail operations within the Nairobi Metropolitan Region. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">The GoK is in partnership with the World Bank, in preparing the Kenya Urban Mobility Improvement Project (KUMIP), that aims to improve urban mobility services within the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and enhance the institutional capacity for resilient and green urban transport development in Kenya. KUMIP embraces a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) approach that seeks to enhance integrated land use planning and transportation planning towards enhancing the development of vibrant communities around railway transit nodes, therefore in essence increasing the usability and effectiveness of the rail as a primary public transport mode. KUMIP will also support GoK’s ongoing effort in urban mobility sector reform. Therefore, as part of KUMIP project preparation, the assignment will seek to understand land-based revenue generation opportunities that can be harnessed by the Kenya Railways and County Governments in the NMA.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">The specific objectives of the assignment are:  </span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">1.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To assess the specific legal and regulatory restrictions and opportunities at both national and county level regarding land revenue extraction for parastatals like KRC, in comparison to county and national government agencies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">2.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To assess the opportunities of land‐based revenue generation for Kenya Railway Corporation and county governments in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area as a result of improved service and TOD investments on the Nairobi Commuter Railway Network</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">Scope of work is detailed in the attached TORs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14.6667px">The outputs of the assignment shall provide guidance to KRC on the opportunities for implementing LVC mechanisms towards generation of additional financial resources, in supporting the development and operations of commuter railway operation in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area operations.

For the context of thisproject, “informality” is defined as the lack of coverage by social insurance.

About 46 percent of the workforce (and 90percent of non-Jordanian workers) are not covered by social security programslike pensions and unemployment insurance. COVID-19 hit informal workersdisproportionally and, in the absence of any protection, pushed many of theminto poverty. While the only way to reduce job informality over the long termis to create more productive jobs, the question in the short term is how toprovide social protection to informal workers. Informal workers areheterogenous though, hence social protection solutions need to be tailored todifferent needs.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&#39;aptos narrow&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&#39;aptos narrow&#39; , sans-serif">Policies to address informality have faced profoundchallenges in reaching out to the large segment of the informal workers. Theyincluded measures to formalize businesses, getting formal businesses toregister workers in the SSC (Social Security Corporation), or incentivizingself-employed workers to register in the mandatory SSC programs. These measures are useful but cannot capturethe complexity of the problem or the heterogeneity of the workers involved, asoutlined in great detail in the studies. Also, while many informal workers arepoor (and poorer than formal workers), most are not poor, which suggests thatmost informal workers have the ability to contribute and/or save, but a morefocused demand side research is required to provide greater insight on whattype of incentives, and services would support increasing the coverage andinducing informal workers to contribute. The demand side research would also beused to provide alternative tailored designs for very heterogeneous workers andneeds, in a financially sustainable manner.<b></b></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&#39;aptos narrow&#39; , sans-serif">To this end, the project aims to support SSC inundertaking research on the demand side geared toward improving theeffectiveness of SSC programs.

in Luxor. Additionally, the firm will undertake a stakeholder assessment and
formulate an engagement strategy.</p><p>2. The firm will develop a set of strategic investment options
and recommendations, cognizant of the urban context and relevant climate risks,
and establish a prioritization framework. The firm will then present priority
adaptation and mitigation interventions, estimating costs, funding mechanisms,
implementation timelines, and scalability.</p><p>3. The firm will estimate costs associated with each
intervention and assess potential losses stemming from inaction. A high-level
cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each intervention. The analysis
will be supplemented by a set of case studies of analogous urban adaptation and
mitigation investments, with lessons learned from successes and challenges.</p><p>4. The firm will formulate a high-level implementation
framework, considering project dependencies and sequencing, and prepare an
investment options and recommendations report and accompanying presentation
materials. Moreover, the consultant will examine and incorporate considerations
of local governance capacity, political dynamics, and legislative frameworks
enabling the successful implementation of the options and recommendations set.</p><p>













</p><p>The success of the service will be judged on its timely
delivery and formulation of a comprehensive proposal responding to the local
context. Emphasizing climate adaptation and disaster resilience investments, the
interventions aim to not only meet immediate needs but also to ensure sustainable
future growth. Thus, success hinges on timely execution, contextual
sensitivity, and the ability to guide urban development initiatives through a
lens of climate resilience and disaster preparedness.</p>{"deadline": "2024-07-11T03:59:00.000+0000", "reference_number": "0002009558", "published": "2024-06-05T04:00:00.000+0000"}

Achieving this depends on replacing fossil fuel use in the heating and transportation sectors with renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Georgia is net dependent on energy imports for transportation, heating, and electricity. Imported natural gas and oil accounted for 48% and 27% of the total energy supply in 2020. GHG emissions from fossil fuel use amounted to 9 Mt in 2020, with natural gas consumption accounting for 55% of total emissions. Meanwhile, residential heating accounted for 45% of emissions related to the use of natural gas.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6pt;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:12.05pt"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">In line with the NDC, the draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) prioritizes decarbonizing the economy, strengthening energy security, and increasing research, innovation, and competitiveness.

This review of the state and economic and financial viability of the use of geothermal heat intends to help revive the development of the sector.

financial and technical inputs provided by the HRIE in generating results at HQ
and country levels and how it can be strengthened in the future; (b) assess the
sustainability of the HRIE’s outcomes, and in particular institutional
sustainability, and how it can be strengthened in the future; (c) identify

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam).

Its primary objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive economicgrowth by supporting the development of a strong and resilient financialsector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makes financial investments to promotethe development of accessible and affordable insurance markets in emergingmarkets.The global insurance marketplace benefits from transfer ofpeak risks to efficient carriers, mainly the global reinsurers. In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

mail-order houses, door-to-door salespersons, hawkers and peddlers, consumer
cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they

grocery retailing is the aggregation of three channels: independent small
grocers, food/drink/tobacco specialists and other grocery retailers. While
there can be modern (e.g. chained) food/drink/tobacco specialists or other
grocery retailers, due to the store’s presence in the channel, these stores are

hereinafter) are the following: </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the practices of different categories of
merchants within different regions in including the rural versus urban split
for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Obtaining the most accurate sample frame (e.g., from
the agencies for statistics) ensuring the size and sector definitions above are
met. </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">2.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face
surveys, while enumerators should have at least 2 years of experience in
face-to-face surveys. The project manager should have at least 5 years of
experience in coordinating surveys. </p><h4>Piloting</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The implementing contractor must test the questionnaire with different
types of respondents (urban/rural, size of merchant, grocery, non-grocery,
etc.) with at least 30 merchants. The implementing contractor must send to the
World Bank Task Manager the data collected from the pilot exercise as well as a
report describing any problems encountered and the proposed solutions. The
report must include any issues that arise as a result of the piloting. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">All modifications to the questionnaire, instructions and sampling
structure that may be suggested from the piloting results must be approved by
the World Bank Task Manager before the survey is implemented. The full survey may
not be launched until the survey instrument is finalized and approved by the
World Bank Group Task Manager. Any changes to the format or ordering of the
questionnaire to facilitate implementation should be consulted with and
approved by the World Bank Task Manager.</p><h4>Data Quality</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The contractor should ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, via
established procedures to check the quality of the data periodically. The
contractor should submit these procedures as part of the proposal.</p><h4>Deliverables</h4><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

The contractor is expected to have a minimum of 4-5 informal merchants
in each group discussion (and ideally 7-8), specifically targeting women
informal merchants, and ensuring a total of 20-22 informal merchants in these 4 groups. The composition of the
participants in each group will be finalized after the approval of the World

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is

The measures shouldreduce costs and reflect in the space economies along major trade routes,especially border settlements&#39; dynamism. In particular, it has long been apparentthat the activities and costs that are faced at border crossing points, such asBenapole – Petrapole, feed into the local economy, supporting jobs and have spilloversinto thriving border economies. In addition to measures that have been agreed uponand implemented at the regional level or between pairs of countries, reformsaround the general sales tax in India can potentially impact the growth ofeconomic centers along interstate trade routes. In that context, the proposedassignment aims to understand the likely impact of trade and transportintegration on different places and economies along current and future traderoutes and the economic centers they connect.

About 46 percent of the workforce (and 90percent of non-Jordanian workers) are not covered by social security programslike pensions and unemployment insurance. COVID-19 hit informal workersdisproportionally and, in the absence of any protection, pushed many of theminto poverty. While the only way to reduce job informality over the long termis to create more productive jobs, the question in the short term is how toprovide social protection to informal workers. Informal workers areheterogenous though, hence social protection solutions need to be tailored todifferent needs.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&#39;aptos narrow&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&#39;aptos narrow&#39; , sans-serif">Policies to address informality have faced profoundchallenges in reaching out to the large segment of the informal workers.

These measures are useful but cannot capturethe complexity of the problem or the heterogeneity of the workers involved, asoutlined in great detail in the studies. Also, while many informal workers arepoor (and poorer than formal workers), most are not poor, which suggests thatmost informal workers have the ability to contribute and/or save, but a morefocused demand side research is required to provide greater insight on whattype of incentives, and services would support increasing the coverage andinducing informal workers to contribute.

<p>The World Bank (WB), in collaboration with the Government of
Egypt (GoE), is soliciting proposals to support the identification and
preparation of climate resilient investments for the Governorate of Luxor. This
engagement seeks to prioritize urban climate and disaster adaptation and
mitigation investments while providing high-level estimates of the benefits and
costs of such interventions. </p><p>The assignment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the necessary mitigation and adaptation investments required to fortify the
urban landscape of Luxor against the escalating challenges posed by rising climate
hazards. Furthermore, by evaluating possible adverse outcomes of inaction and
benefits of action, the assignment intends to provide stakeholders with a
compelling rationale for prioritizing investment in climate and disaster
mitigation interventions.</p><p>Key tasks will include: </p><p>1. The firm will review pertinent national, regional, and
local legislation, regulations, strategy documents, and other source material
concerning investment planning and territorial development, urban and land use planning
and development, and existing climate change strategies and disaster vulnerabilities
in Luxor. Additionally, the firm will undertake a stakeholder assessment and
formulate an engagement strategy.</p><p>2. The firm will develop a set of strategic investment options
and recommendations, cognizant of the urban context and relevant climate risks,
and establish a prioritization framework. The firm will then present priority
adaptation and mitigation interventions, estimating costs, funding mechanisms,
implementation timelines, and scalability.</p><p>3. The firm will estimate costs associated with each
intervention and assess potential losses stemming from inaction. A high-level
cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each intervention. The analysis
will be supplemented by a set of case studies of analogous urban adaptation and
mitigation investments, with lessons learned from successes and challenges.</p><p>4. The firm will formulate a high-level implementation
framework, considering project dependencies and sequencing, and prepare an
investment options and recommendations report and accompanying presentation
materials. Moreover, the consultant will examine and incorporate considerations
of local governance capacity, political dynamics, and legislative frameworks
enabling the successful implementation of the options and recommendations set.</p><p>













</p><p>The success of the service will be judged on its timely
delivery and formulation of a comprehensive proposal responding to the local
context. Emphasizing climate adaptation and disaster resilience investments, the
interventions aim to not only meet immediate needs but also to ensure sustainable
future growth. Thus, success hinges on timely execution, contextual
sensitivity, and the ability to guide urban development initiatives through a
lens of climate resilience and disaster preparedness.</p>{"deadline": "2024-07-11T03:59:00.000+0000", "reference_number": "0002009558", "published": "2024-06-05T04:00:00.000+0000"}

Achieving this depends on replacing fossil fuel use in the heating and transportation sectors with renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Georgia is net dependent on energy imports for transportation, heating, and electricity. Imported natural gas and oil accounted for 48% and 27% of the total energy supply in 2020. GHG emissions from fossil fuel use amounted to 9 Mt in 2020, with natural gas consumption accounting for 55% of total emissions. Meanwhile, residential heating accounted for 45% of emissions related to the use of natural gas.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6pt;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:12.05pt"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">In line with the NDC, the draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) prioritizes decarbonizing the economy, strengthening energy security, and increasing research, innovation, and competitiveness.

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam). Location selection focuses on middle-income countries, with insurancecompanies of sizeable portfolio exposure to large risks and from diverseregions to reach a comprehensive outlook.</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

Its primary objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive economicgrowth by supporting the development of a strong and resilient financialsector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makes financial investments to promotethe development of accessible and affordable insurance markets in emergingmarkets.The global insurance marketplace benefits from transfer ofpeak risks to efficient carriers, mainly the global reinsurers. In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

signing the contract. Interested firms are invited to provide a discussion on
the merchant categories in their proposal. </p><h3>III.1.a  Survey of MSMRs</h3><h4>Objectives</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The objectives of the merchant survey (“MSMR Survey”
hereinafter) are the following: </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the practices of different categories of
merchants within different regions in including the rural versus urban split
for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Obtaining the most accurate sample frame (e.g., from
the agencies for statistics) ensuring the size and sector definitions above are
met. </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">2.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face
surveys, while enumerators should have at least 2 years of experience in
face-to-face surveys. The project manager should have at least 5 years of
experience in coordinating surveys. </p><h4>Piloting</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The implementing contractor must test the questionnaire with different
types of respondents (urban/rural, size of merchant, grocery, non-grocery,
etc.) with at least 30 merchants. The implementing contractor must send to the
World Bank Task Manager the data collected from the pilot exercise as well as a
report describing any problems encountered and the proposed solutions. The
report must include any issues that arise as a result of the piloting. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">All modifications to the questionnaire, instructions and sampling
structure that may be suggested from the piloting results must be approved by
the World Bank Task Manager before the survey is implemented. The full survey may
not be launched until the survey instrument is finalized and approved by the
World Bank Group Task Manager. Any changes to the format or ordering of the
questionnaire to facilitate implementation should be consulted with and
approved by the World Bank Task Manager.</p><h4>Data Quality</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The contractor should ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, via
established procedures to check the quality of the data periodically. The
contractor should submit these procedures as part of the proposal.</p><h4>Deliverables</h4><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

in each group discussion (and ideally 7-8), specifically targeting women
informal merchants, and ensuring a total of 20-22 informal merchants in these 4 groups. The composition of the
participants in each group will be finalized after the approval of the World

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is

<p>The World Bank (WB), in collaboration with the Government of
Egypt (GoE), is soliciting proposals to support the identification and
preparation of climate resilient investments for the Governorate of Luxor. This
engagement seeks to prioritize urban climate and disaster adaptation and
mitigation investments while providing high-level estimates of the benefits and
costs of such interventions. </p><p>The assignment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the necessary mitigation and adaptation investments required to fortify the
urban landscape of Luxor against the escalating challenges posed by rising climate
hazards. Furthermore, by evaluating possible adverse outcomes of inaction and
benefits of action, the assignment intends to provide stakeholders with a
compelling rationale for prioritizing investment in climate and disaster
mitigation interventions.</p><p>Key tasks will include: </p><p>1. The firm will review pertinent national, regional, and
local legislation, regulations, strategy documents, and other source material
concerning investment planning and territorial development, urban and land use planning
and development, and existing climate change strategies and disaster vulnerabilities
in Luxor. Additionally, the firm will undertake a stakeholder assessment and
formulate an engagement strategy.</p><p>2. The firm will develop a set of strategic investment options
and recommendations, cognizant of the urban context and relevant climate risks,
and establish a prioritization framework. The firm will then present priority
adaptation and mitigation interventions, estimating costs, funding mechanisms,
implementation timelines, and scalability.</p><p>3. The firm will estimate costs associated with each
intervention and assess potential losses stemming from inaction. A high-level
cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each intervention. The analysis
will be supplemented by a set of case studies of analogous urban adaptation and
mitigation investments, with lessons learned from successes and challenges.</p><p>4. The firm will formulate a high-level implementation

Achieving this depends on replacing fossil fuel use in the heating and transportation sectors with renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Georgia is net dependent on energy imports for transportation, heating, and electricity. Imported natural gas and oil accounted for 48% and 27% of the total energy supply in 2020. GHG emissions from fossil fuel use amounted to 9 Mt in 2020, with natural gas consumption accounting for 55% of total emissions. Meanwhile, residential heating accounted for 45% of emissions related to the use of natural gas.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6pt;color:rgb( 44 , 62 , 80 );line-height:12.05pt"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">In line with the NDC, the draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) prioritizes decarbonizing the economy, strengthening energy security, and increasing research, innovation, and competitiveness.

Market participation is clearly dependent upon the risk and thetechnology facing the farmer, and market segmentation is high. Mozambicanagricultural policy focuses on increasing yields, through better technologies,and improving market access. About 7.3 percent of the farmers belonged to afarmers’ organization in 2005. It is difficult to assess all farmers’organizations in Mozambique generally as there are many different types,fragmented with less growth traction. Even so, their performance has beenmixed. There has been a lot of support from various development partnerstowards supporting farmer organization, including associations andcooperatives, as a vehicle to improve agricultural productivity (technologytransfer, technical assistance), increasing farmers income and jobs, as well aslinking farmers to markets, with increased aggregation and bargaining power, aswell as value addition from primary agricultural production.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:115%"><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">The experiences from farmer organizations learnt have not been well documentedto better understand why there is limited traction towards farmer organizations.On the part of Government, several attempts have been made, particularly increating an enabling environment for the farmer organization, for example thedevelopment of cooperative law. Support to farmer organization is also centralto fulfil the Agrarian Sector Strategic Plan (PEDSA II), commonly called <i>‘PlanoEstrategio de Desenvolvimento do Sector Agrarian’</i> particularly towards keyresult areas on improving agricultural productivity and value chains and marketlinkages.

consulting firm to prepare and deliver an independent evaluation of the Human
Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment (HRIE) Umbrella Trust Fund.  The objectives for this independent
evaluation include: (a) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the
financial and technical inputs provided by the HRIE in generating results at HQ
and country levels and how it can be strengthened in the future; (b) assess the
sustainability of the HRIE’s outcomes, and in particular institutional
sustainability, and how it can be strengthened in the future; (c) identify
internal and external factors contributing to the ability of the HRIE to
fulfill its mandate; and, (d) identify good practices and lessons learned and
explore options for a future trust fund phase. </p><p>The evaluation has a dual purpose of assessing results ex-post and
providing recommendations for continuation of the Umbrella.  The evaluation also seeks the evaluators to provide
recommendations for consideration and action by development partners and
decision-makers and stakeholders in the World Bank, especially related to the
future of the trust fund. </p><p>This evaluation will be guided by the criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability) as laid out in the 2018 OECD
DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance,<a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aeftimiadis_worldbankgroup_org/Documents/LDriveWBG/1%20Social%20GLU/HRDTF/Evaluation/Advertisement%20text.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif">[1]</span></sup></sup></a><sup>
</sup> and will also incorporate elements
from the Norms and Standards for Evaluation of the UN System on Integrating
Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation.  The application of the criteria should be
consistent with the summative nature of the evaluation and the operational
model of HRIE within the Bank’s Social Inclusion Global Practice. The
evaluators are encouraged to further develop and refine the guiding questions
presented below under each criterion and to include additional questions they
may deem important.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal">The
evaluators should propose the appropriate methodology – reflecting both
performance and process evaluation, as well as recommendations for future
improvements. The evaluation should be conducted based on key evaluation
questions, which may include key informant interviews, desk review of core
activity documentation (proposal summary forms, project and program progress
reports, program annual reports, Partnership Council (governing body) meeting
minutes, program charter, secondary data sources, etc.).  </p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"> </p><p>

TOR is to assist
IFC in developing methodologies to assess certifications on climate eligibility,

international certifications with climate co-benefits (for agri commodities, forestry,

suppliers that include climate-related metrics (for manufactured goods such as
apparel-footwear, electronics, etc.). Methodologies must align with the IFC Definitions

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam). Location selection focuses on middle-income countries, with insurancecompanies of sizeable portfolio exposure to large risks and from diverseregions to reach a comprehensive outlook.</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

Its primary objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive economicgrowth by supporting the development of a strong and resilient financialsector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makes financial investments to promotethe development of accessible and affordable insurance markets in emergingmarkets.The global insurance marketplace benefits from transfer ofpeak risks to efficient carriers, mainly the global reinsurers. In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

long-term benefits for consumers, businesses, and governments. In a recent
study published by Visa, it was estimated that the direct annual
economic growth generated by the increase
in electronic payments could contribute up to 2.4% to
employment and 3.4% to national GDP. Several other studies
(conducted by the private sector and central banks) have shown that at the
macro level, the use of electronic payments can lead
to an increase of 1 to 3% of GDP due to higher consumption, which could be
translated to an increase in employment and an increase in public savings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-align:justify;line-height:105%"><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:105%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif">Defining a vision for a cashless society by decision

hereinafter) are the following: </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the practices of different categories of
merchants within different regions in including the rural versus urban split
for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Obtaining the most accurate sample frame (e.g., from
the agencies for statistics) ensuring the size and sector definitions above are
met. </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">2.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is

<p>The World Bank (WB), in collaboration with the Government of
Egypt (GoE), is soliciting proposals to support the identification and
preparation of climate resilient investments for the Governorate of Luxor. This
engagement seeks to prioritize urban climate and disaster adaptation and
mitigation investments while providing high-level estimates of the benefits and
costs of such interventions. </p><p>The assignment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the necessary mitigation and adaptation investments required to fortify the
urban landscape of Luxor against the escalating challenges posed by rising climate
hazards. Furthermore, by evaluating possible adverse outcomes of inaction and
benefits of action, the assignment intends to provide stakeholders with a
compelling rationale for prioritizing investment in climate and disaster
mitigation interventions.</p><p>Key tasks will include: </p><p>1. The firm will review pertinent national, regional, and
local legislation, regulations, strategy documents, and other source material
concerning investment planning and territorial development, urban and land use planning
and development, and existing climate change strategies and disaster vulnerabilities
in Luxor. Additionally, the firm will undertake a stakeholder assessment and
formulate an engagement strategy.</p><p>2. The firm will develop a set of strategic investment options
and recommendations, cognizant of the urban context and relevant climate risks,
and establish a prioritization framework. The firm will then present priority
adaptation and mitigation interventions, estimating costs, funding mechanisms,
implementation timelines, and scalability.</p><p>3. The firm will estimate costs associated with each
intervention and assess potential losses stemming from inaction. A high-level
cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each intervention. The analysis
will be supplemented by a set of case studies of analogous urban adaptation and
mitigation investments, with lessons learned from successes and challenges.</p><p>4. The firm will formulate a high-level implementation
framework, considering project dependencies and sequencing, and prepare an
investment options and recommendations report and accompanying presentation
materials. Moreover, the consultant will examine and incorporate considerations
of local governance capacity, political dynamics, and legislative frameworks
enabling the successful implementation of the options and recommendations set.</p><p>













</p><p>The success of the service will be judged on its timely
delivery and formulation of a comprehensive proposal responding to the local
context. Emphasizing climate adaptation and disaster resilience investments, the
interventions aim to not only meet immediate needs but also to ensure sustainable
future growth. Thus, success hinges on timely execution, contextual
sensitivity, and the ability to guide urban development initiatives through a
lens of climate resilience and disaster preparedness.</p>{"deadline": "2024-07-11T03:59:00.000+0000", "reference_number": "0002009558", "published": "2024-06-05T04:00:00.000+0000"}

The impact studies’ overall expected outcome is to give a clear picture of whether the Fund’s overall impact indicators have been achieved. The primary impact objective of the Fund is jobs and livelihoods creation. Secondary impact objectives are broadly based on other UN Sustainable Development Goals. The consultant(s) will engage the beneficiaries and provide a detailed report based on the above-stated objectives. Impact measurement is therefore deployed to help companies track their impact and improve in the following areas: impact of investment, for example, measuring employment effect and socioeconomic outcome, improving their social performance/impact assessment and monitoring measures. The study will assess whether the Fund’s investments have contributed to achieving the Fund’s overall impact indicators, especially for those companies that are investees.</li></ul><p> </p> </div> </main>

Market participation is clearly dependent upon the risk and thetechnology facing the farmer, and market segmentation is high. Mozambicanagricultural policy focuses on increasing yields, through better technologies,and improving market access. About 7.3 percent of the farmers belonged to afarmers’ organization in 2005. It is difficult to assess all farmers’organizations in Mozambique generally as there are many different types,fragmented with less growth traction. Even so, their performance has beenmixed. There has been a lot of support from various development partnerstowards supporting farmer organization, including associations andcooperatives, as a vehicle to improve agricultural productivity (technologytransfer, technical assistance), increasing farmers income and jobs, as well aslinking farmers to markets, with increased aggregation and bargaining power, aswell as value addition from primary agricultural production.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:115%"><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39; , serif">The experiences from farmer organizations learnt have not been well documentedto better understand why there is limited traction towards farmer organizations.On the part of Government, several attempts have been made, particularly increating an enabling environment for the farmer organization, for example thedevelopment of cooperative law.

consulting firm to prepare and deliver an independent evaluation of the Human
Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment (HRIE) Umbrella Trust Fund.  The objectives for this independent
evaluation include: (a) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the
financial and technical inputs provided by the HRIE in generating results at HQ
and country levels and how it can be strengthened in the future; (b) assess the
sustainability of the HRIE’s outcomes, and in particular institutional
sustainability, and how it can be strengthened in the future; (c) identify
internal and external factors contributing to the ability of the HRIE to
fulfill its mandate; and, (d) identify good practices and lessons learned and
explore options for a future trust fund phase. </p><p>The evaluation has a dual purpose of assessing results ex-post and
providing recommendations for continuation of the Umbrella.  The evaluation also seeks the evaluators to provide
recommendations for consideration and action by development partners and
decision-makers and stakeholders in the World Bank, especially related to the
future of the trust fund. </p><p>This evaluation will be guided by the criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability) as laid out in the 2018 OECD
DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance,<a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aeftimiadis_worldbankgroup_org/Documents/LDriveWBG/1%20Social%20GLU/HRDTF/Evaluation/Advertisement%20text.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif">[1]</span></sup></sup></a><sup>

from the Norms and Standards for Evaluation of the UN System on Integrating
Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation.  The application of the criteria should be
consistent with the summative nature of the evaluation and the operational
model of HRIE within the Bank’s Social Inclusion Global Practice. The
evaluators are encouraged to further develop and refine the guiding questions
presented below under each criterion and to include additional questions they
may deem important.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal">The

performance and process evaluation, as well as recommendations for future
improvements. The evaluation should be conducted based on key evaluation
questions, which may include key informant interviews, desk review of core
activity documentation (proposal summary forms, project and program progress
reports, program annual reports, Partnership Council (governing body) meeting
minutes, program charter, secondary data sources, etc.).  </p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"> </p><p>

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam). Location selection focuses on middle-income countries, with insurancecompanies of sizeable portfolio exposure to large risks and from diverseregions to reach a comprehensive outlook.</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p style="text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

Its primary objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive economicgrowth by supporting the development of a strong and resilient financialsector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makes financial investments to promotethe development of accessible and affordable insurance markets in emergingmarkets.The global insurance marketplace benefits from transfer ofpeak risks to efficient carriers, mainly the global reinsurers. In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

in electronic payments could contribute up to 2.4% to
employment and 3.4% to national GDP. Several other studies
(conducted by the private sector and central banks) have shown that at the
macro level, the use of electronic payments can lead
to an increase of 1 to 3% of GDP due to higher consumption, which could be
translated to an increase in employment and an increase in public savings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-align:justify;line-height:105%"><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:105%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif">Defining a vision for a cashless society by decision

for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face
surveys, while enumerators should have at least 2 years of experience in
face-to-face surveys. The project manager should have at least 5 years of
experience in coordinating surveys. </p><h4>Piloting</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The implementing contractor must test the questionnaire with different
types of respondents (urban/rural, size of merchant, grocery, non-grocery,
etc.) with at least 30 merchants. The implementing contractor must send to the
World Bank Task Manager the data collected from the pilot exercise as well as a
report describing any problems encountered and the proposed solutions. The
report must include any issues that arise as a result of the piloting. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">All modifications to the questionnaire, instructions and sampling
structure that may be suggested from the piloting results must be approved by
the World Bank Task Manager before the survey is implemented. The full survey may
not be launched until the survey instrument is finalized and approved by the
World Bank Group Task Manager. Any changes to the format or ordering of the
questionnaire to facilitate implementation should be consulted with and
approved by the World Bank Task Manager.</p><h4>Data Quality</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The contractor should ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, via
established procedures to check the quality of the data periodically. The
contractor should submit these procedures as part of the proposal.</p><h4>Deliverables</h4><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is

<p>The World Bank (WB), in collaboration with the Government of
Egypt (GoE), is soliciting proposals to support the identification and
preparation of climate resilient investments for the Governorate of Luxor. This
engagement seeks to prioritize urban climate and disaster adaptation and
mitigation investments while providing high-level estimates of the benefits and
costs of such interventions. </p><p>The assignment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the necessary mitigation and adaptation investments required to fortify the
urban landscape of Luxor against the escalating challenges posed by rising climate
hazards. Furthermore, by evaluating possible adverse outcomes of inaction and
benefits of action, the assignment intends to provide stakeholders with a
compelling rationale for prioritizing investment in climate and disaster
mitigation interventions.</p><p>Key tasks will include: </p><p>1. The firm will review pertinent national, regional, and
local legislation, regulations, strategy documents, and other source material
concerning investment planning and territorial development, urban and land use planning
and development, and existing climate change strategies and disaster vulnerabilities
in Luxor. Additionally, the firm will undertake a stakeholder assessment and
formulate an engagement strategy.</p><p>2. The firm will develop a set of strategic investment options
and recommendations, cognizant of the urban context and relevant climate risks,
and establish a prioritization framework. The firm will then present priority
adaptation and mitigation interventions, estimating costs, funding mechanisms,
implementation timelines, and scalability.</p><p>3. The firm will estimate costs associated with each
intervention and assess potential losses stemming from inaction. A high-level
cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each intervention. The analysis
will be supplemented by a set of case studies of analogous urban adaptation and
mitigation investments, with lessons learned from successes and challenges.</p><p>4. The firm will formulate a high-level implementation
framework, considering project dependencies and sequencing, and prepare an
investment options and recommendations report and accompanying presentation
materials. Moreover, the consultant will examine and incorporate considerations
of local governance capacity, political dynamics, and legislative frameworks
enabling the successful implementation of the options and recommendations set.</p><p>













</p><p>The success of the service will be judged on its timely
delivery and formulation of a comprehensive proposal responding to the local
context. Emphasizing climate adaptation and disaster resilience investments, the
interventions aim to not only meet immediate needs but also to ensure sustainable
future growth. Thus, success hinges on timely execution, contextual
sensitivity, and the ability to guide urban development initiatives through a
lens of climate resilience and disaster preparedness.</p>{"deadline": "2024-07-11T03:59:00.000+0000", "reference_number": "0002009558", "published": "2024-06-05T04:00:00.000+0000"}

Market participation is clearly dependent upon the risk and thetechnology facing the farmer, and market segmentation is high. Mozambicanagricultural policy focuses on increasing yields, through better technologies,and improving market access. About 7.3 percent of the farmers belonged to afarmers’ organization in 2005.

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal">The objective of this
TOR is to assist
IFC in developing methodologies to assess certifications on climate eligibility,
both mitigation and adaptation, for IFC trade and SCF financing, especially
short-term finance (STF) products. This would enable IFC to credibly scale-up
climate financing, resulting in more impact on green jobs, Scope 3 decarbonization,
and flows of climate-enabling goods. The methodology will cover
international certifications with climate co-benefits (for agri commodities, forestry,
etc.) as well as global buyers’ environmental and social management systems for
suppliers that include climate-related metrics (for manufactured goods such as
apparel-footwear, electronics, etc.). Methodologies must align with the IFC Definitions
and Metrics for Climate Related Activities, the MDB Common Principles for
Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking<a href="https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/szuberi_ifc_org/Documents/Documents/CBD/Climate%20Certification/Final%20TOR%20CATSCF%20Components%201%20%202%20v6.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif">[1]</span></a>

Its primary objective is topromote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by supporting the developmentof a strong and resilient financial sector. The Insurance Unit within FIG makesfinancial investments to promote the development of accessible and affordableinsurance markets in emerging markets. With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, droughts,cyber-attacks and pandemics in the recent years, developing countries inparticular can experience significant economic losses due to large insuranceprotection gaps. Insurance and Reinsurance companies face challenges inunderwriting these large, volatile risks.There is a growing need to expand product offerings toinclude innovative solutions that support and expand traditional models, whichmay struggle to accurately address these challenges. The FIG-Insurance Unit,therefore, would like to understand market conditions for innovative risksharing structures (RSF) and insurance linked securities (ILS) that can attractprivate investment and provide additional financial support to mitigate thesehigh severity, low frequency events.The IFC teamintends to hire a firm (vendor) to conduct an assessment i) to understandmarket conditions to explore the idea of structuring a guarantee/risk-sharingtype transaction that will support insurance/reinsurance companies withadditional capacity for these significant risks ii) to identify ways toparticipate in or anchor ILS issuances, either as an investor or as afacilitator for the ILS administrator/underwriter. Thisassessment is expected to better understand supply/demand characteristicsand where additional insurance capacity or funding is needed in order toevaluate IFC’s role in participating in these instruments.Based on the outcome of the assessment, a decision will bemade as to whether IFC should immediately pursue these product lines.The Consultant firm will be expected to produce a globalassessment report ofILS and RSF instruments.The analysis will cover markets in Asia and Africa(there is some flexibility, but the team is targetingTurkiye, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India andVietnam).

In some event,these reinsurers struggle to gain a large foothold in smaller, local insurancemarkets, due to inefficiencies of scale, data and transaction cost.With the increasing frequency and severity of majorcatastrophic risks in the recent years, such as natural disasters, pandemicsand cybersecurity breaches, affecting specifically less mature markets, local or regional reinsurance companies in these emergingmarkets play a key role in aggregating such risks. Their risk portfolios tendto be limited both in geographical and sectoral diversity, thus exposing themto clash risks and insufficient diversification.The IFC team would like to explore thefeasibility of extending its balance sheet and support to suchlocal/regional reinsurers to enable them to better participate in internationalreinsurance transactions to seek better diversification, thereby strengtheningtheir overall capacity to play a key role in their home market.The ultimate goal is toevaluate if this guarantee from a AAA-rated entity like IFC could substitutefor the ratings and/or replace other financial instruments (e.g., letter ofcredit, cash collateral requirements, reinsurance contracts, surety bonds, etc)so that these companies can participate in markets or transactions where keystakeholders and beneficiaries require higher financial strength ratingrequirements from the major international ratings agencies (A.M. Best, Moody’s,Fitch &amp; S&amp;P).If feasible, IFC’s role through the creation of this platformwould then allow local players to increase their financial and technicalcapacity on large, complex risks and expand their operations internationally,increasing their own diversification and stimulating competition in theinternational reinsurance market. Ultimately, thiswould also reinforce their own standing in their homemarket.In this regard, IFC is looking for a vendor firm to produce a global assessment report of regulatory and marketconditions about the dynamics related to guarantee schemes. The analysis will cover the reinsurance value chain in theregions of Africa and Asia, focusing on key markets such as Turkiye, Nigeria,Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, or any othermarkets in these regions that the vendor believes could represent significantdemand for the structure/platform.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"></p><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&#39;calibri&#39; , sans-serif"></span><p><b>FUNDING SOURCE</b></p><p>The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below under the following:</p><ul><li>BB: Bank Budget</li><li>TF0A0542: IFC</li><li>TF0A6728: IFC</li></ul><p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b></p><p>Eligibility restrictions apply:</p><ul><li>[Please type list of restrictions]</li></ul><p><b>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b></p><b></b><p>The World Bank Group invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services.

transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal
or household consumption or utilization, by shops, department stores, stalls,
mail-order houses, door-to-door salespersons, hawkers and peddlers, consumer
cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they
sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or
on a commission basis.

hereinafter) are the following: </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the practices of different categories of
merchants within different regions in including the rural versus urban split
for electronic payment acceptance (EPA). </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the obstacles and motivations for different
types of merchants to accept electronic payments. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in"><span style="font-family:&#39;symbol&#39;">·<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">       </span></span>Understand the potential factors to shift the
acceptance approach or increase EPA within the surveyed merchants.  </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The survey aims to collect quantitative data on
the above questions related to EPA in BiH using a questionnaire that was
developed by the World Bank.  Experience
shows that the questionnaire may take up to 30 minutes to complete. </p><h4>Implementation</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The MSMR Survey will be carried out by the selected
implementing contractor by means of face-to-face interviews with micro-, small-,
and medium sized merchants, using CAPI. However, the World Bank is willing to
consider phone and/or web-based interviews (with CATI/CAWI) under certain
conditions (e.g., in some instances, response rates could be higher when
phone/web-based interviews are done). The World Bank and the consulting firm
may discuss the circumstances under which phone/web-based interviewing may be
necessary. </p><h4>Field Work</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Bidding firms are encouraged to
consider the following activities for their proposal: </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Obtaining the most accurate sample frame (e.g., from
the agencies for statistics) ensuring the size and sector definitions above are
met. </p><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">2.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">      
</span>Recruiting and training enumerators that are
knowledgeable in retailing and payment services.</p><h4>Sample Design</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The sample size will be of 600 MSMRs. The firm should ensure 600
completed interviews. The sample should be nationally representative. Urban and
rural areas should be included as domains of this study. The sampling methodology needs to take into account merchants of
different sizes (micro, small and medium) as well as women merchants, and
urban/rural merchants, as well as the distinction of groceries vs.
non-groceries, amongst other relevant segmentations as well. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The design of the sample will be sent for approval to the World Bank
task manager. During the data collection process, the contracted firm will send
to the World Bank task manager periodic updates on the progress of data
collection. At the end of the data collection the implementing contractor will
provide to the World Bank task manager a
report summarizing the original sample design, weights constructed based on the
original design and final sample, along with any other information that may be
necessary.</p><h4>Respondent</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">For micro and small merchants, business owner should be the respondent.
For medium merchants, operations manager (or similar) should be the respondent.
The respondent should be able to discuss different forms of payments that are
available to the merchant, the choices/preferences of consumers about payment
instruments, the obstacles/incentives to the merchant for using one type of a
payment instrument above others, as well as information on value-added
services, supplier payments, etc. </p><h4>Training, Translation and
Questionnaire Format</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The World Bank requires that the implementing contractor has a
well-worked out plan for training field supervisors and enumerators, including
time allocated for training. The goal of the training is that every enumerator
and every field supervisor completely understand the questionnaires and is
accustomed to interviewing techniques. Enumerators and field supervisors must
also be able to interpret all questions consistently and ask all questions in
the prescribed manner.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The original questionnaire is in English. The selected implementing
contractor is required to translate the questionnaire into all relevant local
languages. The contractor will also back-translate the questionnaire into
English. This back-translation should take place without knowledge of the
original English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the
original concepts are preserved and to pick potential variations in the
understanding of questions emerging from language differences. The final
questionnaire in each language, including its layout as it will be implemented
in the field work, will be approved by the World Bank Task Manager. If the
contractor prefers a specific formatting of the questionnaire to facilitate the
interview and minimize human error, the implementing contractor can use their
own format.</p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">Supervisors and enumerators should have previous experience in survey
implementation, should be available throughout the entire duration of the field
work, and ideally should have some familiarity with the topics of the survey to
facilitate the detection of inconsistencies and misunderstandings. Supervisors
should have a minimum of 2 years of experience as supervisors in face-to-face
surveys, while enumerators should have at least 2 years of experience in
face-to-face surveys. The project manager should have at least 5 years of
experience in coordinating surveys. </p><h4>Piloting</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The implementing contractor must test the questionnaire with different
types of respondents (urban/rural, size of merchant, grocery, non-grocery,
etc.) with at least 30 merchants. The implementing contractor must send to the
World Bank Task Manager the data collected from the pilot exercise as well as a
report describing any problems encountered and the proposed solutions. The
report must include any issues that arise as a result of the piloting. </p><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">All modifications to the questionnaire, instructions and sampling
structure that may be suggested from the piloting results must be approved by
the World Bank Task Manager before the survey is implemented. The full survey may
not be launched until the survey instrument is finalized and approved by the
World Bank Group Task Manager. Any changes to the format or ordering of the
questionnaire to facilitate implementation should be consulted with and
approved by the World Bank Task Manager.</p><h4>Data Quality</h4><p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0in">The contractor should ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, via
established procedures to check the quality of the data periodically. The
contractor should submit these procedures as part of the proposal.</p><h4>Deliverables</h4><p style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent:-0.25in;line-height:105%">1.<span style="font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;">

Background
Information</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Climate, weather extremes, and environmental
degradation are among the major disaster risk drivers for the developing
economies in the Greater Horn of Africa region – which are heavily dependent on
subsistence rainfed farming and livestock herding, and often affected by
conflict and state fragility. According to the African Union Commission, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region is one of the most
vulnerable to climate change impacts and to disaster risks in Africa. The region suffered the worst drought in 40 years
which began in the second half of 2020 and intensified in 2022. The prolonged
drought was followed by severe floods which claimed lives of thousands, put
millions of people at high risk of food insecurity and famine, and displaced
millions of people in the region. For the past two decades, countries in this
region have experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and
man-made hazards which claimed thousands of lives and negatively affect the
livelihoods of millions of people and inflicting huge economic losses. For the
past two decades, countries in this region have experienced an increase in
frequency and intensity of natural and man-made hazards which claimed thousands
of lives and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of people,
inflicting huge economic losses. While many hazards afflict the region, floods
and drought have been the most distressing in terms of impacts, affecting
multiple sectors, livelihoods, and vulnerable groups.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">In response to these escalating challenges, the IGAD
Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC), recognized as a Regional
Climate Centre by the World Meteorological Organization, plays a pivotal role.
ICPAC provides essential climate services and forecasts to its eight member
states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda) and three additional East African countries (Burundi, Rwanda, and
Tanzania) collectively housing over 365 million people. </p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Through its collaboration with national
hydrometeorological services, ICPAC has significantly enhanced the capacity for
early warning and climate information dissemination in the region. This
collaborative effort is critical in supporting preparedness and effective
response across various key sectors, aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate-related
disasters and bolster regional resilience. </p><p style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">Strengthening
IGAD Capacities in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change</span></b></p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The program &#34;Strengthening IGAD Capacities in
Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change,&#34; implemented by the World
Bank and funded through the European Union&#39;s ACP-EU Disaster Risk Management
Program, managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), represents a strategic effort to enhance the institutional capacities
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its Member States
in advancing Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)
within the region.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">The foundation of this program rests on the
achievements of the first phase under the EU-funded ACP Natural Disaster Risk
Reduction Program, which operated from 2014 to 2021. During this period,
substantial progress was made in fostering regional collaboration, enhancing
coordination, and improving communication and information-sharing mechanisms
within IGAD. Key accomplishments included the development of the IGAD DRM
Strategy and other sectoral strategies, financial support for member states’
participation in Hydromet forums, and the facilitation of climate outlook
forums such as the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF), etc.
These forums have been instrumental in disseminating vital regional and
seasonal climate outlooks and information.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">Building on these successes, IGAD is poised to further
its commitment by embarking on the second phase of the program, supported by
new funding from the ACP-EU initiative. This phase will focus on expanding
tools and knowledge in disaster preparedness, response, hydromet, and climate
services. Such enhancements are in line with the global shift from a
response-oriented approach to disaster management towards a more proactive
disaster risk management model, which aims at reducing risk and losses more
effectively.</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify">A significant aspect of this program is its alignment
with the Sendai framework and Paris Agreement, ensuring that the activities
contribute toward increasing the capacity of IGAD and its member states to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and promote climate resilience.
This includes specialized training in climate change and disaster risk
reduction, support for the development of climate-resilient strategies, and
fostering collaboration with global expert centers. Through these initiatives,
IGAD not only aims to strengthen the regional mechanisms for disaster risk
management but also to enhance the overall climate-resilient development of its
member states, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for the region.<b> </b><b></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#4472c4">2. Scope of Work</span></b></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this ToR is
